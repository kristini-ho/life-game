Tracks generations of life, with drawing, customizable colors, and single step or continuous animation (with speed control)! 

Users can draw on the grid in any color with the mouse, and erase what they drew holding down the right click (or equivalent) on a mouse.
If the GUI is in animation mode, it will instantly incorporate the newly drawn cells into its generations of life.

File to run is LifeGUI (extends Life).
